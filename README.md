# README

This HOWTO contains instructions on how to build and configure a TON OS DApp Server in TON blockchain. The instructions and scripts below were verified on Ubuntu 20.04.
# Getting Started

## 1. System Requirements
| Configuration | CPU (cores) | RAM (GiB) | Storage (GiB) | Network (Gbit/s)|
|---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Recommended |24|192|2000|1| 

SSD disks are recommended for the storage.

**Note**: To connect to a DApp Server you are running with client applications (such as [TONOS-CLI](https://github.com/tonlabs/tonos-cli#21-set-the-network-and-parameter-values)), it should have a domain name and a DNS record. Then its URL may be used to access it.

## 2. Prerequisites
### 2.1 Set the Environment
Adjust (if needed) `TON-OS-DApp-Server/scripts/env.sh`:
- specify the network - use main.ton.dev for the main network and net.ton.dev for the developer network
- specify notification email

Set environment variables:

    $ cd TON-OS-DApp-Server/scripts/
    $ . ./env.sh 


### 2.2 Install Dependencies
Ubuntu 20.04:

    $ ./install_deps.sh
    
**Note**: Make sure to add your user to the docker group, or run subsequent command as superuser:


    sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER


### 2.3 Deploy Node
Deploy node:

    $ ./deploy.sh 2>&1 | tee ./deploy.log


**Note**: the log generated by this command will be located in the `TON-OS-DApp-Server/scripts/` folder and can be useful for troubleshooting.

## 3. Stopping, restarting and deleting DApp Server

**Note**: call docker-compose commands from the `TON-OS-DApp-Server/docker-compose/ton-node` folder.
    
To stop the node use the following command:

    docker-compose stop

To restart a stopped node use the following command:
    
    docker-compose restart

To remove the node use the following commands:
    
    docker-compose down
    git reset --hard origin/master
    git clean -ffdx
    
**Warning**: all local files and changes will be deleted from the git tree.

## 4. Redeploying DApp Server

Before redeploying DApp server, make sure to remove the node and reset the git branch:
    
    cd TON-OS-DApp-Server/docker-compose/ton-node
    docker-compose down
    git reset --hard origin/master
    git clean -ffdx

Otherwise redeployment will fail.
When the branch is reset, repeat steps 2.1 - 2.3.
